## Project Description

The To-Do List is a simple yet powerful task management application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to help users organize their daily activities efficiently.

### Objectives:

- Help users manage tasks in a clear, easy-to-use interface.
- Reinforce web development skills, including DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Implement essential functionality such as task creation, deletion, and state tracking.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.  
- **Task Editing**: Modify task details after creation.  
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.  
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed with a simple click.  
- **Persistent Data**: The tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage so they persist even when the page is refreshed.  
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
